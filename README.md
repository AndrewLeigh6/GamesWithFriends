# Games With Friends

## Introduction

Ever have that issue where you and your pals are up for playing something, but actually choosing a game is an absolute nightmare? The boys want to play The Forest, but Andy is cheap and hasn't bought it yet. Loke is dying to play Rocket League, but the thought of losing 0-8 to a bunch of 12 year olds who spent way too long practicing air dribbling fills you with despair. Alex still wants to finish Overcooked 2, knowing full well the group might not survive another session of Loke haphazardly throwing frozen discs of meat around the kitchen with the enthusiasm of an NFL quarterback. Joey would have been happy just playing Minecraft, but you all forgot it existed, and this app only supports Steam games. Whoops.

Games With Friends lets you enter the steam URLs of you and your friends, and shows you a list of games that you all own. You and your friends will then be able to vote separately on which games you'd like to play, and the results will be displayed at the end for everyone to see. By choosing a game this way, it makes your options clear, since you know that everyone actually owns the games shown, and can also act as a reminder for older games you might have forgotten about. This should make the entire selection experience much less painful. At least, until you realise that someone forgot to buy the latest DLC.
